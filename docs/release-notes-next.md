# Next release notes (draft)

This draft describes changes after v1.2.23. It is intentionally not a tag or a
final version announcement.

## Breaking change: explicit StorageClass protocol

`CreateVolume` now requires `parameters.protocol` when the running driver has
more than one protocol enabled. Missing selection returns gRPC
`InvalidArgument` with the valid `nfs`, `iscsi`, and `nvmeof` values. This
prevents an iSCSI- or NVMe-oF-intended class from silently provisioning NFS.
Single-protocol legacy configs retain a fallback to their sole enabled protocol.

StorageClass parameters are immutable. Create a replacement class containing
`protocol`, update workload manifests, and retire/recreate the old class only
after its name and default-class transition have been planned. Existing bound
PVs are not reprovisioned merely because new claims use the replacement class.

## Helm chart

- `controller.replicas` defaults to one. In `fencing.mode=off`, replicas above
  one enable leader election on all capable controller sidecars, preferred
  hostname anti-affinity, and a default PDB. Additive/strict fencing still
  requires exactly one replica.
- Driver containers now request `10m` CPU/`32Mi` memory and have a `256Mi`
  memory limit. Every CSI sidecar requests `10m` CPU/`32Mi` memory and has a
  `128Mi` memory limit. All maps remain overridable.
- `image.digest` supports immutable driver deployment. Sidecar image strings
  already accept digest references, and Renovate explicitly tracks their tag
  defaults.
- The unused additional-iSCSI-portal chart setting is removed. Existing values
  files that attempted multi-portal configuration must remove that entry.
- CHAP and iSCSI multipath remain unsupported; TCP 3260 must be protected by the
  storage-network trust boundary.

## Release governance

- Every GitHub Action reference is pinned to a full commit SHA with a version
  comment, and Renovate preserves/updates those pins.
- CI adds a distinct `CSI Sanity` check, govulncheck, CodeQL, and a tag-only
  Trivy gate that fails on unallowlisted HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities.
- `golang.org/x/text` is updated to v0.39.0 to remediate the reachable
  GO-2026-5970 invalid-input infinite loop reported by govulncheck.
- Tag releases keyless-sign the pushed multi-architecture image. OCI Helm
  charts are keyless-signed and receive an SLSA provenance attestation.

## Documentation compatibility

All shipped direct-driver examples now pass strict YAML parsing. The deployment,
Nomad, topology, StorageClass, production, troubleshooting, architecture, and
disaster-recovery guides now describe only implemented flags, values, and
runtime behavior.
